The pom in pom.should.work.xml should work, but doesn't. From what I've read
this may be because several components in Abdera try to do fancy things with class laoders:
ServiceUtils, Axiom, and Commons Logging to name some. As a result I am getting a 
ClassNotFound exception on org.apache.abdera.Abdera.

No..issue is that maen archiver is setting unique version of snapshot directory names, which is wrong
Tried useUniqueVersions element , but it doesnt pick it up, throws error.

The result? I just copied the libs to ${basedir}/lib and am trying to run using std layout and classPathPrefix of lib.
Copy performed by extracting contents of Classpath-Entries in jar manifest created from pom.should.work.. to input.txt and
 running splitcp.rb | xargs -J % echo cp % lib/

Hmm, till doesnt work. Abdera is trying to be too clever am guessing. Switching to trying 
 java -cp lib/'*':target/abderajson-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar org.communitivity.abderajson.JsonProducer

Curiously, also didn't work. Coming to conclusion 1.0-SNAPSHOT is broken. Going to 0.4.0-incubating
Everything worked with that, using the pom.xml that creates class path entries from repo.
Ran with
 java -jar target/abderajson-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
